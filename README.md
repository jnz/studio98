# Studio98

![logo](img/logo.jpg)

Studio98 is a Vim colorscheme inspired by the Visual Studio 6.0 era on Windows 98/NTâ€”back when editors were simple, fast, and got out of the way. Itâ€™s built for focus, with a bright white background and high-contrast syntax highlighting that makes code instantly readable. No trendy low-contrast themes, no distractionsâ€”just clear, sharp text that keeps you locked into the code.

If you learned programming like me in the â€™90s, these colors will feel familiar. Theyâ€™re wired into muscle memory, making it easy to navigate and think without hesitation.

Studio98 is for those who want a simple, effective color scheme that doesnâ€™t fight for attentionâ€”because the focus should be on the code, not the editor.

I've also designed it to work on terminals. The contrast remains strong, and nothing disappears into the background. A white background isnâ€™t just great for a GUIâ€”it can also work well in a terminal window, making text stand out clearly even in lower-color environments.
