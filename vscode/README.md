# Studio98 for Visual Studio Code

![Studio98](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jnz/studio98/main/img/logo3.png)

Studio98 is a text editor colorscheme inspired by the Visual Studio 6.0 era on Windows 98/NT.

It brings back the classic aesthetic from a time when editors were simple, fast, and got out of the way. Built for focus, it features a bright white background and high-contrast syntax highlighting (Pure Blue for keywords, Dark Blue for types, Green for comments).

No trendy low-contrast themes, no distractions - just clear, sharp text that keeps you locked into the code.
